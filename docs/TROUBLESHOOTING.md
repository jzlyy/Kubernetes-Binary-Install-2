## Common Failure Scenarios
### iptables Module in kebe-proxy
Analysis:
In older Linux systems with kernel versions earlier than 5.1.0, the nf_conntrack_ipv4 and nf_conntrack_ipv6 modules operate independently. Thus, for Linux kernels earlier than 5.0, IPv4-based packet forwarding works correctly.
As Linux kernels evolve (versions â‰¥5.1.0), the nf_conntrack_ipv4 and nf_conntrack_ipv6 modules are merged into the unified nf_conntrack module and no longer exist separately.

Solution:
For newer kernels, directly reference the nf_conntrack module.

### Compatibility Between Kubernetes Version and Pause Container
Analysis:
Kubernetes version updates often require corresponding changes to the pause container version.

Solution:
Modify the pause image version parameter in the containerd configuration file to align with the Kubernetes version.

### Cluster Initialization Timeout or Failure
Analysis:
Mismatched versions between Kubernetes and Docker (e.g., docker-ce, docker-ce-cli).

Solution:
Ensure the Docker version differs from the Kubernetes version by no more than three minor versions.
The Kubernetes version must always be newer than the Docker version.
Explicitly specify compatible Docker engine versions during installation.


### Worker Node Join Failure Due to CRI Adapter Mismatch
Analysis:
Kubernetes 1.24+ removes compatibility with dockershim and directly uses cri-containerd as the container runtime interface.

Solution:
When joining worker nodes, explicitly specify the CRI socket, e.g., cri-containerd.sock or cri-dockerd.sock.

### Network Plugin Fails to Initialize
Analysis:
Each network plugin requires a specific Pod CIDR. For example:
Calico: 192.168.0.0/16
Flannel: 10.244.0.0/16

Solution:
During cluster initialization, explicitly define the Pod CIDR that matches the chosen network plugin.
